        <h2>What is Basketball?</h2>
        <p>
            Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball
            through the defender's hoop, while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.
        </p>
        <h2 id="2">What is the NBA?</h2>
        <p>
            National Basketball Association (NBA), professional basketball league formed in the United States in 1949 by the merger of two rival organizations, the National Basketball League (founded 1937)
            and the Basketball Association of America (founded 1946). It is composed of 30 teams and is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.
            It is considered the premier men's professional basketball league in the world.
        </p>
        <h2>The Court</h2>
        <img src="New_folder/pic7.png" />
        <br/> <br id="3" /><br /> <br /><br /><br />
        <h2>Positions and Roles</h2>
        <p>
            There are 5 main positions :<br />
            1. Point guard <br />
            2. Shooting guard <br />
            3. Small forward <br />
            4. Power forward <br />
            5. Center <br /> <br />
            Traditionally, basketball has 5 specific positions on the court.

            Two guards, two forwards, and a center. <br />
            Let's break down each position...
        </p>
        <h4>1. Point guard</h4>
        <p>
            Responsible for advancing the basketball up the court and setting up the team's offense. This requires the point guard to be highly skilled at
            dribbling and passing.Once the offense has been set up, the point guard must be able to read what the defense is doing and make smart decisions
            . A high level of basketball IQ is crucial for this position which is why the point guard is often referred to as the on-court coach.
            The player filling the point guard position must be unselfish (there's nothing worse than a selfish point guard) and aim to get their teammates
            involved on the offensive end of the floor. This requires crystal clear knowledge of the playbook as well as understanding their teammate's
            strengths and weaknesses. Knowing what areas of the court your teammates thrive in allows the offense to take advantage of mismatches.
            Defensively, the point guard is responsible for guarding and disrupting the opposition's main ball-handler. They do this by playing aggressive
            (but smart) full-court defense attempting to tip the basketball loose but ensuring they always stay between their opponent and the basket.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Shooting Guard</h4>
        <p>
            The shooting guard (also known as the off guard) is often one of the shorter players on the team and generally starts an offensive possession on the wing.This is a scoring position and is often
            be filled by the team's best outside shooter. But the shooting guard position requires more than outside shooting...This player must be able to shoot consistently from outside, midrange, and close
            to the basket, as well as be able to make a variety of layups.Being able to score from anywhere on the floor means the shooting guard is always a threat,They're also the team's secondary
            ball-handler and can help advance the basketball up the court if the point guard is competing against a tough opposition defender.On the defensive end of the floor, a great shooting guard defender
            is quick and able to avoid screens from the opposition's bigs.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Small Forward</h4>
        <p>
            The small forward is often the most versatile of the 5 basketball positions on the court both offensively and defensively.They're long and athletic which allows them to be incredibly disruptive
            on the defensive end of the court and usually makes them the team's best defensive player.The best small forwards also have an offensive game...Similar to the shooting guard position,
            they're able to shoot consistently from outside, score inside, and also penetrate and create for their teammates.
        </p>
        <h4>4. Power Forward</h4>
        <p>
            The power forwards required to be both strong and skilled.In past years, the player in this position always played close to the rim and scored the majority of their points in the paint.
            In today's game, the power forward needs a good midrange jump shot and will be even more effective if they're able to consistently hit a three-point shot. Players who can do this are known as a 'stretch four'.
            Whether this player spends most of their time inside the three-point line or on the perimeter will depend on the offense the coach chooses to run with their team.
            Defensively, having size and strength is important for boxing out their opponent and securing rebounds.
        </p>
        <h4>5. Center</h4>
        <p id="4">
            The center spends most of the game close to the basket.Offensively, most centers don't have a consistent midrange shot or a three-point shot, nor are they typically the focus of most offenses.
            Instead, they will score often score the majority of their points by staying close to the rim and scoring off offensive rebounds or by receiving short passes when a perimeter player penetrates and their defender is forced to provide help defense.
            This requires that they have good hands and a high basketball IQ to know where to move around the rim to give passers the best angle.
            The best centers have a good post game and can score with a variety of moves from the low post area. This is especially necessary when they get switched onto a smaller and weaker player.
            Defensively, the two main responsibilites of a center is to defend the basket and rebound the basketball.
