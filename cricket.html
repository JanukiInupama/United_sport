        <div class="para">
            <p>A cricket pitch is the rectangular playing space in the middle of a cricket ground. It has a flat grass floor and is 22 yards (20.12 meters) long by 10 feet (3.05 meters) broad. The pitch's limits are delineated by painted lines, and a center line known as the "crease" separates it into two halves.
                <br><br>
                Because it is where the batter and pitcher begin their innings, the crease is significant in cricket. The pitcher throws the ball from one end of the crease while the batter stands at the other. If the ball is thrown outside the permitted limits of the field, the crease aids the judges in determining whether it is "wide" or "no-ball."
                <br><br>
                Depending on variables like the temperature, type of soil, and regularity of use, the pitch's state can change. Before a game, it is crucial to prepare the field correctly to make sure that it offers a level playing area for both teams. Cricket contests that are more thrilling and difficult can result from a well-prepared pitch.

                The collection of three stumps (vertical poles) and two bails (horizontal pieces) that are positioned at either end of the rectangle field is referred to as the wicket in the game of cricket. The aim of the bowlers team is to throw the wicket, and the aim of the batting team is to score runs while defending the wicket.
                The batter is deemed "out" if the pitcher strikes the wicket with the ball and removes one or both bails. 
                
                <br><br>
                A batsman can be dismissed in a number of different ways, such as being bowled (when the ball strikes the wicket directly), being caught (when a fielder catches the ball before it hits the ground), being stumped (when the batsman leaves their crease to play a ball and the wicket-keeper removes the bails before the batsman can return to their crease), and more.
                As both teams fight to either defend or remove the stumps and bails, the wicket is a crucial component of the game and can frequently be the cause of extreme excitement and anxiety.
