				<br><br>Football is governed internationally by International Federation of Association Football (FIFA). The most prestigious international football competition is the World Cup.  The FIFA World Cup is conducted every four years, which is the most awaited championship for millions of people. Teams from all around the world participate. 

				Football is played in accordance with a set of rules, known as the Laws of the Game.  The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals, then the game is a draw. 
		        There has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles.  
		
                China being the mother of Football may raise a few eyebrows. In early days, this sport was played by kids in China which was later picked up by the senior fellows. Despite the origin in Asia, the sport was well received and adapted by people of Europe and South-American countries. Spain, Italy, Brazil, Argentina, and England are some of the best football playing countries.

			<p>A very important gear for every football player. These are specially designed shoes with spikes on the bottom that provide great traction on grass.
			<br><br>
			The choice of ball color is made according to the table color and its surroundings. Manufacturers often indicate the quality of the ball with a star rating system, usually from one to three, three being the highest grade. As this system is not standard across manufacturers, the only way a ball may be used in official competition is upon ITTF approval (the ITTF approval can be seen printed on the ball). There are different types of soccer shoes and cleats, and each type is made to help improve your game. They are specifically made to work with different synthetic grass surfaces.

            Interchangeable cleats and molded cleats are best used with natural grass surfaces, where your shoes have to bite into the ground in order to create traction. Indoor soccer cleats and shoes are best used on sport courts, asphalt, concrete and gym floors. Turf shoes are specifically designed to be used on fields that are covered with synthetic grass.

			<h3> Shin Guards </h3>
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="para">	
			<p> These are used to protect the player’s shin. While playing football, opponent players try to injure players by kicking in the shin area. It could be an intentional or unintentional act by the player. Hence, shin guards are a protective equipment.
			<img src="football2/shinguard.jpg" alt="shin guard"  style="width:200px; height:200px; float: left; ">
			<br><br>
			Shin guards are one of the suggested preventive methods. Their main function is to protect the soft tissues and bones in the lower extremities from external impact. Shin guards provide shock absorption and facilitate energy dissipation, thereby decreasing the risk of serious injuries.
			<br><br>
			 Some researchers have even suggested filling such gaps with semi-rigid materials (Ankrah and Mills, 2003). Although many authors advocate the use of shin guards, the ideal structural design characteristics have not been specifically defined. The BS EN 13061 (British Standard European Norm) standard for shin guards aims to prevent lacerations, contusions and punctures but not tibia fractures, and these standards determine the protective clothing for players in all football associations.  The main concern when formulating this standard was to avoid any harm that could be caused by a striker’s cleats; high kinetic energy impacts and the related consequences were not taken into consideration.

			<p> Although a soccer ball can be put together in many different ways, there is one design so ubiquitous that it has become iconic. This standard soccer ball is stitched or glued together from 32 polygons, 12 of them five-sided and 20 six-sided, arranged in such a way that every pentagon is surrounded by hexagons. Postmodern paint jobs notwithstanding, the traditional way to color such a ball is to paint the pentagons black and the hexagons white.
